This site uses a few tools to make publishing seamless
1. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for writing
2. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for rendering the markdown into static pages
3. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) for editing the HTML when needed
4. [Github](https://github.com) and [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) (instead of terminal) to push blog / code updates
5. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for hosting (Github Pages cannot render this Jekyll theme perfectly)
6. [Chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com) or [Claude](https://claude.ai/) for editing, thought partnership, code generation

I started by cloning [this template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) and using [this helpful guide](https://refinedmind.co/obsidian-jekyll-workflow) to set it up.
