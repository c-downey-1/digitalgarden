title: Expertise is Convex

One of my favorite ideas is that *expertise is convex*. It comes from the essay [the Startling Convexity of Expertise](https://byrnehobart.medium.com/the-startling-convexity-of-expertise-5058e90a6c19) by [Byrne Hobart](https://www.thediff.co/).

Concavity - function that is increasing at a decreasing rate (or decreasing at an increasing rate)

Another way to think about it: Convex functions curve upwards and concave functions curve downwards.

So imagine my surprise when I spotted him doing some light cardio at the gym one Saturday. “Hey dude,” I said, “don’t you normally work out Mon/Wed/Fri?”_
