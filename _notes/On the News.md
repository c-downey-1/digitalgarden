I generally do not read the news.

There are a few reasons for this.

1. [Gell-Mann Amnesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_amnesia_effect) / [Knoll's Law](https://effectiviology.com/knolls-law/)
<br>

2. Having worked with reporters at some of the top publications, they are generally too rushed to get the story *true* in the *Things They Carried* sense. I believe most things are factually correct but miss important nuance / context. B/c of Gell-Mann Amnesia it is hard to notice these things in the moment.
<br>

3. Negativity Bias
<br>

4. There have been zero newspaper articles / news events which really influenced concrete decisions in my life. Especially things that I wouldn’t have picked up eventually from colleagues, neighbors, etc. This seems especially true about political stories.
<br>

5. Fear and bait drive clicks. Clicks get money. Journalism at some fundamental level has to optimize for this. Maybe this is functionally the same as 4. 
<br>

6. Don’t have the time, energy, or focus to incorporate a dozen or even a few articles into my world view each day. If this incorporation doesn’t happen what is the point of reading the articles?
