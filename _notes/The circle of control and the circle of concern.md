title: The Circle of Control and the Circle of Concern

The circle of control captures all of those things which someone is able to actually influence. Our habits, responses, processes, decisions, etc.

The circle of concern captures all of those things which someone cares about. Geopolitics, cancer, the stock market, etc.

Many of the things that concern us are out of our control. Probably most are. The circle of concern is much wider than the circle of control.  But we need to own and take responsibility for our reactions to that which concerns us. 

This concept is similar to what is called outcome independence or process orientation.

The stoics figured this out long ago...

Epictetus:

>Some things are up to us and some are not up to us. Our opinions are up to us, and our impulses, desires, aversions—in short, whatever is our own doing. Our bodies are not up to us, nor are our possessions, our reputations, or our public offices, or, that is, whatever is not our own doing. The things that are up to us are by nature free, unhindered, and unimpeded; the things that are not up to us are weak, enslaved, hindered, not our own.

Aurelias:

>You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.

The stoics seem to ask us to minimize our circle of concern. To direct your energy to only those things which you can influence. But this is all easier said than done.

Minimizing your circle of concern is a process. Some areas are easier than others: for instance, to stop caring about geopolitics, stop reading the news. Other areas—a spouse's health, for instance—I'm not so sure there is much room to minimize.
