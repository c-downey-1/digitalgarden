[From Paul:](https://paulgraham.com/todo.html)

- Don't ignore your dreams
- Don't work too much
- Say what you think
- cultivate friendships
- be happy

He derives these from a list of top 5 regrets of the dying by a palliative care nurse.

1.  I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
2.  I wish I hadn’t worked so hard.
3.  I wish I’d had the courage to express my feelings.
4.  I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5.  I wish I had let myself be happier.

**How does one know what living a life true to oneself actually consists of?**

When I was 18 years old, entering Wesleyan University as an ambitious freshman, my main goals in life were to make a lot of money, acquire a lot of power, and ultimately become the president or at the least a US senator or SCOTUS justice. These were my actual goals, as ridiculous as they now sound.  I think most teenage boys go through this stage and, unfortunately, some never make it out.  

There is a hollowness that accompanies the singleminded pursuit of wealth.  I saw it etched into the faces of many of my colleagues when I worked at an investment bank.  Some there knew it too, but were trapped by their mortgages, kids, and lifestyle creep.  

Many would have chosen a different life had they foreseen what awaited them, but now it *feels* too late.

But are the activists and the non-profit workers doing much better?  It certainly does not seem that way. One problem for them is the cultural transition from *having* a purpose to *finding* a purpose. Nietzsche of course warned us about this. 

*Finding* purpose is often what people mean by "living true to yourself" these days. But the singleminded pursuit of meaning, passion, and impact can be just as damaging as the pursuit of wealth or power. Many ask of their career what it can not give, or devote their lives to ideas they don't understand in full. 

The solution is falling back into those identities that have scaffolded meaning throughout human history. These are the identities and relationships that *have* purpose by virtue of their reciprocal obligations. Parent, spouse, neighbor, mentor etc.
