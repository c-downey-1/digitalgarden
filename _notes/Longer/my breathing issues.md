title: Breathing Issues

In 2016 I checked myself into the ER because I was gasping for air. 

The ER doctor administered a corticosteroid by nebulizer, a common treatment for asthma attacks. She also ran a chest CT and an EKG before sending me on my way a few hours later when my symptoms had improved a bit and my test results were normal. 

It was the beginning of a 5 year process that would cost me thousands of dollars, dozens of doctor appointments, and years of struggling to sleep because of feeling short of breath. 

Ultimately, my problem was resolved after I stumbled across a reddit discussion of perceived shortness of breath as a consequence of acid reflux (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease or Laryngopharyngeal Reflux). My symptoms abated after a few weeks on a once-daily, 30-cent over the counter pill for treating reflux. 

But before I figured out the why...

I worked with:
- 2x pulmonologists
- 1x cardiologist
- 2x neurologists (one who mused flippantly that I "might have ALS")
- 2x primary care physicians
- 1x ER doctor

Some of tests administered:
- 3x pulmonary function tests (w and w/o corticosteroids)
- 1 exercise EKG/stress test
- 2x EKG
- 5x blood tests (testing iron, b12, etc)
- 1x Electromyography
- 2x Chest CT (1x w/ contrast)
- 1x Neurological assessment
- 1x Chest X-Ray

I also spent $2,100 over the course of 7 months on a website called CrowdMed. This platform offered bounties to doctors who could help solve complicated cases like mine. I uploaded redacted versions of all my test results and received about 20 responses from the providers on the site. Half of these responses suggested that the issue was likely anxiety. A handful of others proposed a variety of fatal diseases which, if the doctors had spent more time on my profile, they would have known would have killed me by that point. *None of the 20 responses were useful.*

Years later, I asked chatgpt (4o) to see if it could have spared me from all of this nonsense. I wrote:

>Help with a potential diagnosis. I am also consulting a doctor so don't worry about that.
>
><br>
>Symptoms include: shortness of breath (like gasping for air). Despite this, the oxygenation numbers are fine. Belching. I do not respond to asthma drugs. No pulmonary or cardiological issues upon testing.

The prompt is roughly how I would describe my issue to doctors about a year into the issue after some of the initial testing. I assumed that 4o would ask follow up questions or ask what pulmonary and cardiological tests were performed. I thought it may suggest I upload the results of my testing so it could be better informed.

Instead, it pinpointed the exact issue.

> It sounds like you might be experiencing **functional or non-cardiopulmonary causes of dyspnea** (shortness of breath), given that your oxygen levels are normal, asthma medications don’t help, and cardiac/pulmonary tests are clear. Some possibilities to consider:<br><br>**1. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) / Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)**<br>
>-  **Symptoms:** Shortness of breath, excessive burping, throat tightness, chronic cough, and sometimes a feeling of choking or gasping for air.<br>
>- **Mechanism:** Stomach acid can irritate the airways and vocal cords, leading to a sensation of breathlessness despite normal lung function.<br>
>-  **Tests:** pH monitoring, esophageal manometry, trial of acid suppression (e.g., PPIs).

In fact, instead of requiring *more* information about my symptom presentation. I found that chatgpt identified reflux as the first possibility even when I reduced the context significantly by eliminating the fact that pulmonary and cardiological testing was normative. Keep in mind, this is exactly what doctors knew from the very first presentation of my symptoms, prior to any testing whatsoever.

Response:

> Your symptoms—shortness of breath (gasping for air) with normal oxygen levels and belching—could be related to a few different conditions. Since you’re consulting a doctor, they’ll be able to do a thorough assessment, but here are some possibilities to consider:
> <br><br>

>- Acid reflux can cause irritation in the esophagus and airway, leading to shortness of breath, belching, and even a sensation of gasping.

## Some Hypotheses 

How did the doctors miss what in retrospect seems so simple? 

1. **Red-Herring Symptoms** <br>
	One explanation is that the belching was the most revealing symptom, but doctors were understandably primed by the more alarming one—my feeling of not being able to breathe. When a patient presents with shortness of breath, it makes sense to check for asthma, lung function issues, and heart problems. You send them to a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, or maybe even consider a neurological cause. It’s completely reasonable _not_ to jump to, “Ah yes, this is just minor esophageal irritation.”

2. **[[overfitting|Overfit]] Generalist Physicians** <br>
	Another hypothesis is that generalist physicians may struggle with unusual presentations of relatively common issues. Acid reflux is incredibly common, but is most often accompanied by heartburn, which I did not experience. So my primary care physicians likely developed their heuristics about what reflux looks like from hundreds of patients that didn't look like me nor exhibited a symptom presentation that resembled mine. 

3. **The doctors had more data than the AI -- and that made things worse** <br>
	There was perceptual data the doctors had which the AI didn't. The doctors could see that I was young, skinny, and exercised a lot. They likely developed an unconscious and complex perception of my general health that biased them against conditions (like LPR/GERD) that are most often consequences of poor lifestyle choices. It is also likely that doctors are *more* influenced by these biased perceptions than AI models are.
