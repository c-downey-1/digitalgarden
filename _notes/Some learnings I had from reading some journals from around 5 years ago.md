Some of the things that came up for me as I spent a few hours reading through some old journals:

1. You can't change the past. What I have done in the past led to who I am today—the person that ultimately I am proud of and happy with. It is not worth it to gripe over time misspent. 
<br>

2. The more that I learn and read, the more insecure I feel about the scope and validity of what I think I know well. I think this is probably a good thing—[[Epistemic humility|Epistemic Humility]].
<br>

3. I won't have enough time to read all of the books that I want to read. (And that's okay!)
<br>

4. Many of the problems that I faced when I was 25 are still with me today. Many of the same anxieties. But also some have improved. Can't tell if this is just due to a random walk...
<br>

5. At 25 I felt that the goalposts that I had for myself did not necessarily [[Self-Discrepency Theory|align with the goalposts society had for me]]. But my own goalposts also could be overly simplistic—not deeply capturing what I was aiming for. I've needed to move away from measuring-sticks that don't directly relate to quality of time spent. For example, plowing through 100 books in a year vs savoring and digesting 10-20. It's easy to over-optimize towards a quantity.
<br>

6. There was a lot of pointless and unsuccessful striving for perfection. The most impactful changes in these five years have been more about creating and cultivating habits that compound into who I become over time. 

From June, 2019 (25 years old):

>When I am studying, learning, growing I always feel as if I am preparing for something—some greatness—that will come later in life

This still feels true to me, but I now more acutely feel that the "greatness" that is being prepared for is just life itself—being a good spouse, father, citizen, etc. These are not trivial or easy things.

In the same entry I also provided a somewhat unvarnished look at the desires that I felt drove my life at the time:

>- Health
>- Happiness
>- Creativity
>- Develop a refined and well-thought through model of the world
>- Be Intelligent
>- Appear Intelligent
>- To not have to sell my labor
>- Have enough money to not worry about money

I noted in the entry that the main problematic desire was about *appearance* of intelligence. I felt that this drive, "highlights the fact I find it difficult not to care about other people's impressions of me." I think I'll continue to optimize towards not caring about *most* other people's impressions of me, but be honest with myself that this is not something easy for any human to do.

I also think the desire to *be* intelligent is silly—[I mostly agree with Scott Alexander on this point.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/) After all, intelligence is mostly already baked in and there is no particular reason to think intelligence influences the value or dignity of any human. *But* it is easier to think a desire is silly than to expel the silly desire.
