title: Inflicting pain on our future selves

We consistently sacrifice from our future by making poor choices in the present. Moreover, **we actually inflict pain on our future selves in the pursuit of relatively trivial pleasures in the present.**

Diet and exercise are the obvious examples. For relatively minor gustatory pleasures we reduce (often significantly) the quality and quantity of life that our older self experiences. 

My wife and I were walking in our neighborhood recently when an older man stopped us to say hello. He said that we were a beautiful and healthy couple before remarking that he would trade everything he owned to get his health back. 

I know this sounds super clichéd, but it actually happened. I genuinely believe that this cliché exists because this hypothetical "trade" is something that a significant share of older individuals dream of making.

The relationship between Sue (Margaret Qualley) and Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore) in *The Substance* is a great example of this. Sue's relatively minor pleasures-deciding not to Switch in order to attend a party or to have sex with a random man-end up aging Elisabeth years for each small offense. 

There are a few things at play here.<br>
1. **Hyperbolic Discounting**. We drastically discount the future, favoring immediate gratification over future rewards even if they are significantly more beneficial. This is likely one of those tricky levers that is part genetic, part cultural, and part personal narrative (see [[The power of narrative]]).

2. **Information Asymmetry**. The younger self does not concretely understand the consequences of certain behaviors in the same way as the older self.

3. **Evolution of Values**. Even if the younger self understands the concrete consequences and does not discount the future, they often don't value things exactly the same as the older self. For instance, you might expect a younger/older self to value time spent with grandchildren differently.

### We probably shouldn't be discounting health hyperbolically (duh)

There are quite a few reasons why discounting money makes sense. Economies have growth and inflation rates. The value of 100 units of wealth today is not the same as 100 units in 10 years. There is also a significant opportunity cost of not being able to spend wealth in the present.

But it doesn't really make sense to talk about health in any of these terms. Most importantly, there is no compelling reason to believe that a certain level of health in the future is inherently less valuable than the same level in the present. There are smaller forms of discounting that may make sense. For instance, personal mortality risk and the likelihood that modern technology cures the main causes of suffering both suggest at least minimal discounting. But these small factors certainly do not justify the *de facto* high level of discounting that most people are applying.

Of course, *rationally buying* and *acting on* this argument are two different things. Most of us will continue to be cruel to our future selves, even when we make our best-faith effort to consider our older self as a moral patient. Nevertheless, we must try to remember that our subjective sense of the benefits of exercise and healthier eating is terribly misguided. 

Try asking yourself: what would my future self think about this decision? He would probably tell you to get your ass to the gym and lay off the donuts.
