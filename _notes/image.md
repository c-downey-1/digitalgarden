To add an inline image, save the image in assets/ and paste the below html code directly into the markdown file.

```
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image.jpg"/> 
```

things to note:
1. replace image.jpg with file name
2. you will not see this in obsidian
3. check spacing once website is served
4. if in a numbered list, use ```<br>``` to add spacing so that numbers remain sequential when site is generated
