>Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.

> The Great Revolt [Butlerian Jihad] took away a crutch… It forced human minds to develop.

—Frank Herbert, *Dune*

The [Butlerian Jihad](https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Butlerian_Jihad) in *Dune* was a universe-wide rejection of the destruction of the human mind by computers. 

Technologies influence our mental abilities. It is clear to see today how reliance on google has diminished our capacity to remember things. GPS and writing had a similar effect. This isn't always bad; we now have more opportunity to do higher-value mental work than rote memorization.

But the costs may be particularly high if we let AI do our writing and reading for us. Functionally, this is the same as letting AI do our thinking for us. 

We generally prefer the path of least resistance, so if we are not thoughtful about how we use this tool, we may devolve into a creature that is more instrumentally effective, but notably less human.

*Every individual will have to choose to use AI as a crutch or a tool.* 

If it is used as a crutch, we may lose too much; we may lose everything.
