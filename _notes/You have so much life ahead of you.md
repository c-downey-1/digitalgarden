title: You have so much life ahead of you

Five or six years ago I was listening to Samantha Powers on Tyler Cowen’s podcast when she made a simple comment that filled me with wonder. 

She was talking about some book—the title of which I have forgotten—and said: “I read it when I was in Bosnia as a kid in my early 20s, and it made a deep impression.”

>*a kid in my early 20s*

At the time, I could not imagine that someone would consider themselves a kid in their early 20s. I was in my mid 20s and already felt incredibly old. Now, nearly 31, I feel even older.

Of course, Powers didn’t mean 'kid' literally. But her nonchalance in using the term made me reflect on how different we are at various stages of life.

When I was 18 I was so sure of myself. Cocky, even. I *knew* that I was an adult. I was certain that most of my beliefs would be stable for the rest of my life. Looking back on that teenager is amusing. He got some things right, but he was definitely a kid. I suspect I may feel similarly about my 25 or 30 year old self in the future. Perhaps I even hope for such an outcome.

Maybe you should be concerned if there are not significant differences between your present and past selves. Have life’s experiences really not influenced you? Are you then lacking experiences or are you neglecting to learn?

The upside of all of this is that I have so much life ahead of me, and you, dear reader, probably have quite a bit ahead of you too. We may feel a pretty concrete sense of where things are headed, but it is best to treat this feeling with a healthy dose of epistemic humility. We cannot predict how we will evolve.

For an alternate perspective: [[You don't have much time left]]
