title: Going on a walk or to the gym can reset your mood and productivity

Here is a simple model of mental health that is true *most of the time*: Mood and behavior are deeply interlinked. 

For instance, people who are depressed stay in bed for longer, and so we blame the depression for the behavior of staying in bed. But, it is also true that people who don't get out bed for extended periods of time will become depressed, or have a more depressed mood.

This is a core assumption in cognitive behavioral theory. Changing behaviors alters mood. It's also incredibly easy to forget this relationship when in a bad mood. 

The other day I spent the morning lost in an internet hole that left me completely mentally exhausted by noon. Sometimes when I get into that state, I have a tendency to mindlessly play chess, scroll twitter, or be otherwise unproductive for the next few hoursâ€”wasting my time and ultimately draining my mental energy further.

Instead I forced myself to go to the gym, practicing a little bit of [opposite action.](https://dbt.tools/emotional_regulation/opposite-action.php) When I finished at the gym, I had the energy to make a healthy meal and get back to productive work.

Here are some things that work well as breaks for me:
- Taking a walk outside
- Going to the gym
- Setting a timer for 5 minutes and meditating
- Playing with a dog
- Listening to some music

The important thing is to disconnect completely from the work, ideally stepping away *physically and mentally* from the computer or book.
