title: The relationship between expertise and value is convex

One of my favorite ideas is that *the relationship between expertise and value is convex*. It comes from the essay [the Startling Convexity of Expertise](https://byrnehobart.medium.com/the-startling-convexity-of-expertise-5058e90a6c19) by [Byrne Hobart](https://www.thediff.co/).

At the simplest level, this idea expresses that there are increasing returns to skill and knowledge development.

These increasing returns show up in someone's labor market value and in [[Knowledge builds on itself|their personal pursuit of knowledge.]]

Some definitions[^1]:

> **Convexity** is a property of a function that is increasing at an increasing rate (or decreasing at a decreasing rate). Another way to say this is that the second derivative of the function is positive or that it is a relationship that curves upward like a "U."<br><br>**Concavity** is the opposite of convexity. It is a function that is increasing at a decreasing rate (diminishing marginal returns) or decreasing at an increasing rate. 

So what does Bryne mean when he says that expertise is convex? Plotting an example of salary vs skill acquisition in a marketplace (courtesy of Claude) helps us understand his point.

As someone picks up a few skills as a novice, their salary increases but not very significantly. Take a junior investment banker who is learning how to build her first financial model in excel. This is no doubt a valuable skill. But it is also a skill that will command only modest premiums in the labor market unless she also builds skills in accounting, valuation, relationship building, business strategy, common sense, etc. As the junior banker learns more skills, the marginal labor market value of each additional skill increases. 

**Convex relationships exhibit increasing marginal returns.**  

Now let us think about variables which share a concave relationship. The classic example of this is the relationship between utility and wealth. Someone who is poor values each extra dollar highly whereas Elon's life is barely impacted by the marginal dollar. 

**Concave relationships exhibit decreasing marginal returns.**

The important questions one might ask themself:
1. How valuable is expertise in any given domain?
2. How easy is it to become an expert in a given domain?

[[In some domains, becoming an expert is relatively easy.]] Some times becoming *the* expert is even easy. However, [[The convexity of expertise varies by domain|the convexity of expertise varies by domain]].



**Footnotes**

[^1]: These definitions are how economists / finance folks use the terms. Note that in mathematics concavity just describes the second derivative. The mathematical term for convex functions is "concave up" and for concave functions it is "concave down"
