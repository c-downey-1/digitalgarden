> Ten days ago, Dr. John Carrigg, Ph.D., [passed away](http://www.weirtondailytimes.com/page/content.detail/id/634284/John-Carrigg.html?nav=5010) at the age of 93. He fought in World War Two in Europe as part of the 8th Armored Division. He received the Purple Heart. After the war, he returned to the US and got a doctorate in history from Georgetown. He went on to teach for more than half a century. He also farmed--using draft horses--and was involved in politics. He and his wife raised ten children. He was vibrant, friendly, demanding, empathetic, and devout.<br><br>
> 
> As a professor, he encouraged me, he counseled me, and most importantly he just spoke to me as if we were equals. He was an inspiration. He also tested me...<br>
> <br>
> 
> I was a proud student. Arrogant, even. I knew my stuff, and I _knew_ that I knew it. So as a sophomore I am confidently sitting in Dr. Carrigg's class, completely in my element. He was drawing a map. As it took shape, I recognized that he was drawing the eastern Mediterranean region. Finally, he circled a spot.<br>

> "Anyone know what this is?"
> <br><br>
> I looked around, and nobody raised their hand. So I did.
> <br><br>
> 
> "Mr. [Last name]?"
> <br><br>
> 
> "Gallipoli."
> <br><br>
> 
> "Good! Do you know another name for it?"
> <br><br>
> 
> He was testing me, but I was up to the task. "The Dardanelles." Take that!
> 
> <br>
> Dr. Carrigg smiled at me. "Excellent, Mr. [Last name]." Inside, I was strutting. "But do you know _another_ name for it?"
> <br><br>
> 
> I panicked. My mind raced. I was silent for a moment, then inspiration struck. "Hellespont."
> <br> <br>
> 
> Carrigg's smile continued, perhaps even broader. "Good work, Mr. [Last name]."
> <br><br>
> 
> I had passed the test. Or so I thought.
> <br><br>
> 
> "But what else did the ancient Greeks call this place?" <br><br>
> I drew a complete blank. I had just given three names for the same spot on the map when nobody else in the class had given a single one. I concentrated as hard as I could but nothing came to mind. 
> <br><br>
> 
> He saw right through me.
> <br><br>
> 
> "I knew I would find a gap, Mr. [Last name]. There's always a gap."
> <br><br>
> At this point, one might expect to be given the missing answer. Instead, he returned to his lesson. I sat there dumbfounded. He was plowing ahead, just like he did with those draft horses. Eventually I regained my composure and started taking notes again. When class ended he had a couple other students walk up to him, and I had another class to get to. I left the room, still in a daze.<br>
> <br>
> 
> Over the next days and weeks, I thought about what he said. There _is_ always a gap. I hadn't failed, I had just been showed a gap in my knowledge. He hadn't castigated me for it, he just pointed it out and left me with that lesson. Giving me the answer would have robbed me of the lesson.

> Years later, I had moved across the country. A map came up on the news. Before the newsreader could say anything, of its own accord a word was shouted from my lips. "Bosphorus!" I yelled it so loud that I startled my wife. Understandably confused, I related the above story. I thought of Dr. Carrigg and smiled.
> <br><br>

> The world is a better place for having Dr. Carrigg be a part of it. I am a better man for having known him. 
> <br><br>
> 
> I, and many many others, will miss him.
