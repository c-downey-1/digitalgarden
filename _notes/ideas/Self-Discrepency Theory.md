title: Self-Discrepency Theory

Self-Discrepency Theory was developed by E. Tory Higgins. 

The theory proposes that negative feelings arise from discrepancies between who a person actually is and who they could or ought to be.

Higgins theorizes that there are three "domains" of the self, and two different "standpoints" from which the self can be viewed. 

**Domains of the self**
- The actual self - this is who the person is in reality
- The ideal self - this is who the person wants to be
- The ought self - this is who the person believes they ought to be

**Standpoints of the self**
- Own - This is an individuals perception of their actual/ideal/ought self
- Other - This is how others perceive the individuals actual/ideal/ought self [^1].

Most people feel that there is a significant discrepancy between the aspirational/ideal self and the self that actually goes about living life. [[Inflicting pain on our future selves|The aspirational self makes big plans]]: "from this day hence I will eat healthfully, control my vices, and exercise consistently—all while being a patient and fun spouse and friend." We hear that the self *ought* to be a CEO, the President, and the local hero. The actual self will eat a bowl of ice cream at 8pm.

The most interesting part of Higgins' theory is how he situates dejection and agitation as different failure modes of living up to expectations.

Failing to live up to your aspirational self results in depression, sadness, and dejection. While failing to live up to societies expectations (the Ought self) causes feelings of agitation like anxiety, the fear of criticism, or the worry of being ostracized (shame).

Historically the ought and ideal self were more closely aligned, and religious institutions provided practices and frameworks to better align the actual self with the ideal and ought self. Secularism, self-actualization, and authenticity movements split these two apart.

Modern society lacks the institutionalized mechanisms for this alignment. Part of this is because most of us aspire to be something different than what society expects from us. Indeed, this rebellion helps shape and define our aspirational self. [[The Top of Paul Graham's Todo List|For most people, this is an intellectual and spiritual dead-end.]]
