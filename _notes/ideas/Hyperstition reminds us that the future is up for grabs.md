[[Hyperstition]] reminds us that the future is up for grabs. Whoever tells the most compelling story about tomorrow may shape it.

Through this lens, political narratives are not mere rhetoric, but rather active forces that shape what is politically and **materially** possible. In the modern geopolitics, state and non-state actors seed narratives that erode or bolster social realities.

This also implies that [[being unrealistic in a focused way can change the course of reality]] and that [[the allocation of imagination and belief is an under appreciated factor in which technologies and ideologies dominate the future]].
