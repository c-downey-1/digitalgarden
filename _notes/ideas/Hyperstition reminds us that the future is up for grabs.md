[[Hyperstition]] reminds us that the future is up for grabs. Whoever tells the most compelling story about tomorrow may shape it.

Through this lens, political narratives are not mere rhetoric, but rather active forces that shape what is politically and **materially** possible. In the modern geopolitics, state and non-state actors seed narratives that erode or bolster social realities.

This also implies that [[being unrealistic in a focused way can change the course of reality]] and that [[the allocation of imagination and belief is an under appreciated factor in which technologies and ideologies dominate the future]].

Kevin Kelly:

>Despite our political situation, I am more optimistic than ever before. That's because I intentionally choose to be more optimistic each year. Optimism is a choice, not a personality trait. I am aiming to be as optimistic as I possibly can because a big dose of optimism is required to make better things real. We have to imagine a desirable future first, in order to make it happen. Complex good things won't happen inadvertently. Sure, our problems are bigger than ever before, but our ability to solve problems grows even faster. We can accomplish difficult things when we believe they are possible. Therefore our future is shaped by optimists, and I want to be one of those.
