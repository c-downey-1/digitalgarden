The planning fallacy is our tendency to **underestimate** the amount of resources it will take to accomplish something *even when we have completed similar projects in the past*.

This finding is apparently one of the more robust and replicable psychological tendencies of humans, and applies to both time and costs of projects.

One example study: students were asked to estimate *conservatively* what day they would finish a project at a 50%, 75%, and 99% confidence interval. Only 14% of students finished by when they self-assessed a 50% likelihood. 19% for 75%. Remarkably, less than half (46%) of students finished by the time they self-assessed at a 99% likelihood. 

We exhibit the opposite tendency if we are estimating how long it will take someone else to complete a project. We expect they will go over time and over budget.

Important correctives:
1. Average your estimate for someone else and yourself
2. Break the task down into its smallest constituents and estimate each individually
3. Ask how long similar projects in the past *really* took
