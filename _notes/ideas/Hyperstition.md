A hyperstition is a fiction that engineers itself into reality. It is an idea that actualizes itself, triggering cultural feedback cycles which shape and produce the world.

Hyperstitions are *initially* false in an important sense. But the fiction structurally reorganizes the world because of the actions of stakeholders who are, consciously or not, influenced by it. The fictions that activate themselves were in a different sense true the entire time. **A false idea is *made true* by its own effects.**

The name is a play on superstition, which is a false belief that remains false.

A related concept is a self-fulfilling prophecy—where an individual’s belief directly influences their behavior. For example, if a teacher thinks a certain student will fail she may neglect helping that student because she unconsciously believes it is hopeless.

Hyperstition is broader. These fictions act on the level of culture by narrative intervention, transforming the possible into the actual.

**Through this lens, ideas become weaponized, contagious, agentic, power-seeking, and warfare.** 

Hyperstition moves away from traditional philosophies where ideas *represent* the world to one where ideas *produce* the world. Thus, [[hyperstition reminds us that the future is up for grabs]].

[[Hyperstition provides a framework to talk about the power of imagination in a rigorous way]].
