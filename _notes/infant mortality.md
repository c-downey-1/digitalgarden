In less than two centuries, infant mortality in rich countries has dropped from around one-in-three to near zero.

This is one of those many absolutely magical things which have happened in the last few hundred years that we now just take for granted. Really try imagining living in a world where 1 out of 3 babies die. It is unfathomable. Really try imagining living in a world where a now mundane infection posed a real risk of death.

It makes me wonder what types of things we will look back on 200 years from now that will feel similarly unfathomable. Will it seem crazy that 5-10% of deaths are from Alzheimers? Will it seem crazy that people used to die from cancer? That people used to die at all?
