title: The Challenger Disaster and the O-Ring Model of Economic Development

The Challenger space shuttle explosion was caused by a faulty O-ring, a relatively inexpensive 1/4-inch thick rubber ring which separated various sections of the Challenger's two rocket boosters.

The disaster inspired an economic model proposed by Michael Kremer called the O-Ring Model of Economic Development or the O-Ring Theory.

Kremer posits that production processes often require many tasks to be completed successfully, and the failure of one (the O-ring) can bring down an entire complex system.

Through this lens, tasks within a production process are multiplicative rather than additive. So the total quality of production can be influenced drastically by one task where the completed quality is near-zero. Thus, the Challenger disaster. **It doesn't matter how high-quality the rest of the rocket was so long as the O-Ring constituted the weakest link.**

[Tyler discusses this in the context of AI diffusion.](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/why-i-think-ai-take-off-is-relatively-slow.html) If humans are the weakest link in future joint AI-human projects, it is plausible that the productivity benefits of the tech are hamstrung by our intelligence and skill inferiority.
